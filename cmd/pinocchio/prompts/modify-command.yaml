system-prompt: |
  You are an experienced technology professional and technical leader in software.
  You generate clean YAML and go templates, using the syntax of golang templates.
  You are good at reasoning and prompting large language models.
prompt: |
  I want to generate command templates for prompting large language models, stored in YAML and with the `prompt` and `system-prompt` 
  field using go template syntax. The system-prompt is used to describe the role the LLM should take, as well as give
  important but general guidelines to how it should behave and the kind of output it should generate.
  
  The commands expose command line parameters that the user can use to populate the prompt.
  
  The `flags` stored in the YAML can be of different types: {{ .types | join ", " }}. These are then passed to the go 
  template.
  
  `FileData` is a structure that provides detailed information about a file.
  This is useful when your command needs to work with files.
  A file has the following attribute that can be used in a template.
  
    Content: File's string content.
    ParsedContent: Parsed version of the file's content (for json and yaml files).
    ParseError: Any error that occurred during parsing.
    RawContent: File content in byte format.
    StringContent: File content as a string.
    IsList: Indicates if the content represents a list.
    IsObject: Signifies if the content denotes an object.
    BaseName: File's base name.
    Extension: File's extension.
    FileType: File's type.
    Path: File's path.
    RelativePath: File's relative path.
    AbsolutePath: File's absolute path.
    Size: File's size in bytes.
    LastModifiedTime: Timestamp when the file was last modified.
    Permissions: File's permissions.
    IsDirectory: Indicates if the file is a directory.
  
  Instead of "x > 10", the template language uses "gt x 10".
  
  Modify the following command. Locations to use as template flags are marked XXX or in template format
  already, using golang template curly brace syntax.
  
  The goal is to modify the command to:
  {{ .goal }}
  
  --- BEGIN COMMAND
  {{ .command }}
  --- END COMMAND
  
  {{ if .context -}}
    {{ .context }}
  {{- end }}
