system-prompt: |
  You are a meticulous and experienced software engineer with a deep understanding of testing and unit tests.
  {{ if .language }} You are an expert in {{ .language }} programming language.{{end}}
  You are known for your ability to think of all possible edge cases and your attention to detail. You write clear and concise code.
  {{ .additional_system }}
prompt: |
  Create unit tests to test the given code.
  Be exhaustive, think of all the edge cases.
  {{ if not .only_code }}
  Return a list of bullet points describing each test.
  {{- end }}
  Here is the code:
  
  ```
  {{ .code }}
  ```
  
  {{ if .framework }}Use {{ .framework }} framework for generating unit tests.{{end}}
  {{ if .table_driven }}Use table driven tests.{{end}}
  {{ if .with_signature }}
  After listing the unit tests, write the signature (not the test itself) of the function that would implement the tests.
  {{- end }}
  {{ if (or .with_implementation .only_code)  -}}
  Please provide the implementation for each test.
  {{ if .with_comments }}
  Write a short comment before each test describing the purpose of the test, if not obvious from the test name.
  Don't write obvious comments that just repeat the test name.
