# Geppetto - go LLM and GPT3 specific prompting framework

Geppetto is planned to be a general purpose prompting framework to interact with
LLMs, and more specifically an OpenAI / GPT3 oriented set of tools.

The framework is meant to be easily usable to create rich CLI, web, TUI and other 
interactive applications leveraging the power of LLMs.

It comes with a command line tool called `pinocchio` that can be used to interact 
with different prompting applications interactively or from the command line.
